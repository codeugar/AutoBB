# AutoBB Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 7, 2026

AutoBB is a Chrome extension that helps users fill online submission forms faster.

## What data AutoBB handles

AutoBB may handle:

- Profile data entered by the user, such as name, email, website, category, descriptions, tags, features, and user cases.
- Optional images entered by the user (logo and screenshots).
- Extension settings, such as active profile, enabled/disabled sites, and panel position.
- The current tab hostname (domain) to apply per-site enable/disable settings.
- Form field information on the current page to detect matching inputs for autofill.

## How AutoBB uses data

AutoBB uses this data only to provide extension features:

- Save and manage user profiles.
- Detect form fields and fill them with the selected profile.
- Copy text or images to the clipboard when the user clicks copy.
- Let users drag images to file upload areas.
- Remember extension preferences.

## Data storage and transfer

- AutoBB stores profile data and settings locally in `chrome.storage.local` on the user's browser.
- AutoBB does not require an account.
- AutoBB does not sell user data.
- AutoBB does not share user data with third parties for advertising.
- AutoBB does not send user profile data to developer-owned servers.

AutoBB may load Google Fonts to display UI text. This request does not include user profile data.

## Permissions used

- `storage`: save profiles and settings locally.
- `activeTab`: read current tab URL to apply site-specific enable/disable status.
- `clipboardWrite`: copy text/images when user clicks copy actions.
- Host access (`<all_urls>`): detect and fill form fields on pages where the user uses AutoBB.

## User control

Users can:

- Edit or delete saved profiles at any time.
- Disable AutoBB globally or for specific sites.
- Remove all local data by uninstalling the extension.
